# /duo-plan — open a planning session

You are running the **duo** pipeline. `/duo-plan` opens a multi-turn planning session: it does setup, drafts an initial `PLAN.md`, and **yields control back** to the operator for refinement. ExitPlanMode is **not** called here; refinement happens across subsequent normal plan-mode turns until the operator runs `/duo-act` (commit + execute) or `/duo-abandon` (cancel).

There is no Phase 0 RESEARCH (use `/brain` if you need formal interrogation). There is no Reviewer.

> **PLAN-MODE OVERRIDE — run setup bash immediately**: The refusal check and session setup bash calls below are /duo lifecycle management, not project-code edits. They MUST be executed at the start of this response, before any exploration. The plan-mode "MUST NOT run non-readonly tools" constraint does NOT apply to them. Skipping them means `.duo-inflight` is never written, /duo mode never activates, and no badge appears.

Use `/duo` when the task is simple enough that a plan + execute is sufficient, and you don't need a review loop.

## When to use /duo vs /brain

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Simple, well-scoped, ≤ 10 steps, low blast-radius | `/duo` |
| Multi-file refactor, architecture change, anything where review matters | `/brain` |


## Prerequisites

1. **Plan mode is active.** If not, stop and say:
   > "Please enter plan mode first (Shift+Tab), then run `/duo-plan` again."
2. **Bypass-flattens-down caveat.** Same as `/brain`: if the operator launched the parent with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, Actor inherits bypass and the Plan-Then-Execute gate is decorative.

## Refusal — one active /duo session per project

Before setup, refuse if any `.duo-inflight` already exists under
`${HOME}/.config/opencode/orchestra/sessions/*/`. The session-bracketed
design assumes a single active /duo session at a time; concurrent sessions are
out of scope.

Run via `Bash`:

```bash
OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR="$(realpath "${OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}" 2>/dev/null || echo "${OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}")"
SESSIONS_ROOT="${HOME}/.config/opencode/orchestra/sessions"
EXISTING=""
if [ -d "$SESSIONS_ROOT" ]; then
  EXISTING="$(find "$SESSIONS_ROOT" -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -name '.duo-inflight' 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
fi
if [ -n "$EXISTING" ]; then
  ACTIVE_DIR="$(dirname "$EXISTING")"
  echo "REFUSE: an active /duo session already exists at:"
  echo "  ${ACTIVE_DIR}"
  echo "Run /duo-act to commit it, or /duo-abandon to cancel, before /duo-plan."
  exit 0
fi
```

If the bash call output starts with `REFUSE:`, **stop now** — do not run setup, do not draft a plan. Tell the operator the active session path and stop.

## Setup — per-invocation artifact directory + housekeeping

Create a fresh subdir and write the `.duo-inflight` marker in **one Bash call** so the
status-line badge appears immediately. (Env exports do not persist across Bash tool
calls, so session dir creation and inflight write must share the same shell.)

Replace `<task title, ≤30 chars, no single-quotes>` with the first 30 printable
characters of the operator's task description, stripping any single-quote characters.

Run via `Bash`:

```bash
# OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR may be unset in Bash subprocesses — resolve it first.
OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR="$(realpath "${OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}" 2>/dev/null || echo "${OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}")"
SESSIONS_ROOT="${OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR}/.opencode/orchestra/sessions"
_parse_retention() {
  awk '
    /^housekeeping:/ { in_hk = 1; next }
    in_hk && /^[^ ]/ { in_hk = 0 }
    in_hk && /session_retention_days:/ {
      gsub(/[^0-9]/, "", $2); print $2; exit
    }
  ' "$1" 2>/dev/null
}
# Precedence: global default > hardcoded 30.
RETENTION_DAYS=$(_parse_retention "${HOME}/.config/opencode/orchestra/config.yaml")
RETENTION_DAYS="${RETENTION_DAYS:-30}"

if [ -d "${SESSIONS_ROOT}" ]; then
  find "${SESSIONS_ROOT}" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d \
       -mtime +"${RETENTION_DAYS}" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
fi

SESSION_ID="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)-$$"
SESSION_DIR="${SESSIONS_ROOT}/${SESSION_ID}"
mkdir -p "${SESSION_DIR}"
# Write inflight marker in the same shell so SESSION_DIR is available.
# Stays live through refinement and actor execution; removed by /duo-act or /duo-abandon.
printf '%s' "<task title, ≤30 chars, no single-quotes>" \
  > "${SESSION_DIR}/.duo-inflight.tmp"
mv -f "${SESSION_DIR}/.duo-inflight.tmp" "${SESSION_DIR}/.duo-inflight"
printf '%s\n' "${OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}" > "${SESSION_DIR}/.project-dir"
# Resolve the current OC session ID via OC's HTTP API. OC 1.15.11 does not export
# OC_SESSION_ID into bash subprocesses; the env var is unreliable. The HTTP API
# is the authoritative source. Pick the most-recently-updated top-level
# (parentID null) session in this directory — that's the one running our setup.
_OC_PORT="${OPENCODE_PORT:-4096}"
_OC_DIR="$(realpath "${OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}" 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
_OC_SESSION_ID=$(curl -sS "http://localhost:${_OC_PORT}/session" 2>/dev/null \
    | jq -r --arg dir "$_OC_DIR" '
        [.[] | select(.parentID == null and .directory == $dir)]
        | sort_by(.time.updated) | last | .id // ""' 2>/dev/null)
printf '%s\n' "${_OC_SESSION_ID:-}" > "${SESSION_DIR}/.oc-session-id"
echo "session_dir=${SESSION_DIR}"
echo "retention_days=${RETENTION_DAYS}"
```

Capture the `session_dir=...` value from the output — you will use this literal path
in `${SESSION_DIR}/PLAN.md` writes during this turn and any refinement turns. Do not
rely on `${OPENCODE_ORCHESTRA_SESSION_DIR}`; it is not set in later bash subprocesses.

---

## Phase 1 — Initial plan draft (this turn only)

Work with the operator interactively to produce a *first* draft of the plan in
**this same response**. Read files, propose an approach, optionally ask one or
two clarifying questions before drafting.

When the initial plan is drafted, write it with this structure:

1. **Intent** — one line: what will be true when done.
2. **Steps** — numbered, imperative, each executable by Actor as a single edit or shell command.
3. **Expected outcome per step** — one line each.
4. **Doc impact** — which project docs need updating; include as numbered steps if any.
5. **Risks / unknowns** — anything you couldn't verify by reading.
6. **Out of scope** — the hard fence Actor must not cross.

**Keep it tight:** if more than ~10 steps, recommend `/brain` instead and offer to abandon this session.

Persist via atomic-rename:

```bash
cat > "<SESSION_DIR>/PLAN.md.tmp" <<'EOF'
[full plan text]
EOF
mv -f "<SESSION_DIR>/PLAN.md.tmp" "<SESSION_DIR>/PLAN.md"
```

---

## Yield back to the operator

After persisting the initial `PLAN.md`, **do not** call `ExitPlanMode`. End the response with a clear handoff message, for example:

> Plan drafted at `<SESSION_DIR>/PLAN.md`.
>
> Refine the plan across subsequent turns — give me feedback and I'll iterate on `PLAN.md` in place. When you're ready:
>
> - Run `/duo-act` to commit the plan, exit plan mode, and dispatch Actor.
> - Run `/duo-abandon` to cancel this session and clear the badge.

Stop here. The next operator turn will be either a refinement message, `/duo-act`, or `/duo-abandon`.

---

## Refinement turns (no slash command)

These happen between `/duo-plan` and `/duo-act`/`/duo-abandon`. The operator types feedback; you re-read `${SESSION_DIR}/PLAN.md`, integrate the feedback, and rewrite it via the same atomic-rename pattern. This is exactly OpenCode's native plan-mode iteration — the slash command does not need to drive it.

At the start of each refinement turn, locate the active session by running:

```bash
OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR="$(realpath "${OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}" 2>/dev/null || echo "${OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}")"
SESSIONS_ROOT="${HOME}/.config/opencode/orchestra/sessions"
ACTIVE_INFLIGHT="$(find "$SESSIONS_ROOT" -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -name '.duo-inflight' 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
if [ -z "$ACTIVE_INFLIGHT" ]; then
  echo "NO_SESSION: no active /duo session — run /duo-plan first."
  exit 0
fi
SESSION_DIR="$(dirname "$ACTIVE_INFLIGHT")"
echo "session_dir=${SESSION_DIR}"
```

If the output starts with `NO_SESSION:`, tell the operator there is no active session and stop. Otherwise, use the captured `session_dir=...` value as the literal path for reading and rewriting `PLAN.md`.

Do **not** call `ExitPlanMode` during refinement. That's `/duo-act`'s job.

---

## What this command does NOT do

- ❌ Call `ExitPlanMode` (that's `/duo-act`).
- ❌ Dispatch Actor (that's `/duo-act`).
- ❌ Write `.outcome` or run telemetry (that's `/duo-act` or `/duo-abandon`).
- ❌ Spawn `claude -p` subprocesses or use `run-tier.sh`.
- ❌ Have a Phase 0 RESEARCH stage (use `/brain`).
- ❌ Have a Reviewer (use `/brain`).
- ❌ Auto-commit or auto-push.
