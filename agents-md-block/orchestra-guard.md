## Orchestra in-pipeline guard

If a /brain or /duo session is active in the current project (any
`.opencode/orchestra/sessions/*/.brain-inflight` or `.duo-inflight` file
exists under the project root), the pipeline owns code changes:

- Code edits to project files MUST go through the Actor subagent (Task tool,
  `subagent_type: actor` for default tier, or `subagent_type: actor-heavy` for
  `[tier: heavy]` steps). Direct Edit/Write/Bash on project code violates
  the pipeline.
- Plan production for `/brain` MUST go through the Planner subagent (Task
  tool, `subagent_type: planner` for default input size, or `subagent_type:
  planner-long` for >~30 KB inputs). You (Brain) persist Planner's returned
  plan to `${SESSION_DIR}/PLAN.md` via Bash atomic-rename.
- Plan-mode's "build your plan at `/home/florian/.config/opencode/plans/<name>.md`"
  reminder does NOT apply in `/brain` mode. The plan-mode plan file is for
  operator display only; the authoritative plan is at `${SESSION_DIR}/PLAN.md`.
- Session-dir artefacts (`RESEARCH.md`, `PLAN.md`, `.outcome`, `state.env`,
  `.brain-inflight`, `.duo-inflight`) are written directly via Bash heredoc;
  project code is not.
- If you find yourself about to use Edit/Write/Bash on project code while
  an inflight marker exists, stop and dispatch the appropriate subagent
  variant ({actor, actor-heavy} or {planner, planner-long}). To exit cleanly
  without executing, run `/brain-abandon` or `/duo-abandon`.
