# OpenCode Orchestra

A three-tier orchestration system for OpenCode: **Brain** (Anthropic Opus 4.7) delegates reasoning, implementation, and review across **Planner** (claude-code-glm-5.1), **Actor** (claude-code-qwen3-coder-next), and **Reviewer** (claude-code-kimi-k2.6) tiers using OpenCode's native `Task` tool for subagent dispatch. Single global install at `~/.config/opencode/`; usable from any project.

## Intro

OpenCode Orchestra solves the cost/capability trade-off for multi-step code work. A single powerful Brain (Anthropic Opus 4.7) orchestrates cheaper specialized tiers: a read-only Planner for structured reasoning, a write-capable Actor for implementation, and a read-only Reviewer for quality gates. The project name's `--non-Anthropic` suffix refers to the **worker tier** — Planner, Actor, Reviewer, and Actor-Heavy are all non-Anthropic (SoHoAI flat-rate); Brain itself runs on Anthropic Opus 4.7 because the orchestrator's job (interrogation, planning, dispatch, review judgment) benefits from Anthropic's strongest reasoning model. The key design choice: **Option B — native OpenCode subagents, not separate processes** — which keeps the architecture simple and preserves permission modes and plan-approval gates.

## Slash commands vs subagents

Two distinct kinds of `.md` file in this repo, deployed to two different OpenCode-canonical directories. Conflating them is a common source of confusion, so the distinction is stated explicitly here.

| Kind | Source | Deployed to | Invoked by | Has model/tools frontmatter? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Slash command** | `commands/*.md` | `~/.config/opencode/commands/` | Operator typing `/name` | No (it's a prompt template) | Operator-facing entry point; the body becomes the parent (Brain) session's prompt |
| **Subagent** | `agents/*.md` | `~/.config/opencode/agents/` | Parent calling `Task` tool with `subagent_type: name` | **Yes** — per-agent model and tool permissions | Dispatchable worker with isolated context, its own model, its own tool permissions |

**Slash commands (`commands/*.md`):** `brain.md`, `brain-abandon.md`, `duo-plan.md`, `duo-act.md`, `duo-abandon.md`. These are pipeline orchestrators — operator-facing entry points whose body becomes Brain's instructions. They are not "workers"; they coordinate work by dispatching subagents via the `Task` tool.

**Subagents (`agents/*.md`):** `planner.md` (model: `claude-code-glm-5.1`, read-only tools), `actor.md` (model: `claude-code-qwen3-coder-next`, Edit/Write/Bash), `actor-heavy.md` (model: `claude-code-kimi-k2.6`, Edit/Write/Bash), `reviewer.md` (model: `claude-code-kimi-k2.6`, read-only tools). Each has frontmatter that declares its model and tool permissions; OpenCode enforces both at dispatch time.

**Brain is neither.** Brain *is* the parent OpenCode session that executes `/brain` (or `/duo-act`). It runs on Anthropic Opus 4.7. Brain cannot be implemented as a subagent because Phase 0 of `/brain` is multi-turn interactive interrogation with the operator, and OpenCode subagents are single-dispatch units (they cannot have multi-turn dialog with the operator). The orchestration logic in `commands/brain.md` is therefore intentionally in `commands/`, not `agents/`.

**Auxiliary directory:** `agents-md-block/orchestra-guard.md` is yet a third thing — a markdown block injected by `deploy.sh` into `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` between sentinels, to remind Brain about pipeline rules on every turn. Not a subagent, not a slash command — a project-instruction snippet.

Use it when you want code changes reviewed before landing, or when you want to isolate reasoning from implementation for cost control.

## How to use it

### Interactive conversation (default)

Talk to Brain normally. Brain delegates to Planner/Actor/Reviewer as needed. No forced pipeline. Example: "explain the SoHoAI routing architecture" — Brain reads files and answers directly.

### /duo — lightweight (Brain plans, Actor executes), session-bracketed

`/duo` is a three-command session-bracketed pipeline. `/duo-plan <task>` opens a planning session (sets up the session_dir, drafts an initial `PLAN.md`, and yields back). The operator then refines the plan across as many normal plan-mode turns as needed. `/duo-act` commits the plan, calls `ExitPlanMode`, dispatches Actor, and runs cleanup + telemetry. `/duo-abandon` cancels the active session cleanly. No Reviewer. Example: "add a docstring to rag_engine/search.py::search_rag" — low risk, no review needed.

Workflow: (1) Launch a OpenCode session (any model works for `/duo`; `claude-code-kimi-k2.6` recommended). (2) `Shift+Tab` to enter plan mode. (3) `/duo-plan <task>`. (4) Refine across turns until the plan is right. (5) `/duo-act` to execute (or `/duo-abandon` to cancel); on approval, `Shift+Tab` to bypassPermissions if desired, Actor runs uninterrupted.

Splitting the plan-approval gate into an explicit `/duo-act` (rather than the slash command barrelling through to `ExitPlanMode` in one response) means rejection-or-redirect during planning is now first-class: refinement is a normal multi-turn conversation, not a rejected-plan-and-informally-keep-chatting situation. Telemetry attribution stays correct because `.outcome`-file mtime bounds the T2 time window (see §Telemetry).

### /brain — full pipeline (Opus orchestrates, cap-3 review loop)

Enter plan mode, type `/brain <task>`. Opus runs Phase 0 (RESEARCH, inline — interrogates you across as many turns as needed; the operator's natural-language signal — "proceed", "go ahead" — ends Phase 0), then Phase 1 (PLAN via Planner), Phase 2 (IMPLEMENT via Actor, one step at a time), Phase 3 (REVIEW via Reviewer, loop up to 3 times). Example: "refactor the SoHoAI LiteLLM routing to support a new provider" — high-risk, multi-step, needs review loop.

`/brain-abandon` cancels the active /brain session cleanly at any point — writes `.outcome=abandoned`, removes the inflight marker, runs T2 telemetry, and clears the badge. The cleanup block also runs automatically on Phase 0 abandonment ("never mind", "drop it"), Phase 1 outright rejection at the plan-approval gate, and Phase 3 BLOCK verdict — so every exit path bounds the T2 telemetry window.

**Pipeline-rules guard (2026-05-05):** plan-mode and `/brain` give Brain conflicting instructions about who produces the plan — plan-mode's per-turn "build your plan in `~/.config/opencode/plans/<name>.md` using Write" reminder out-competed `/brain.md`'s loaded-once "dispatch Planner via Task tool" instruction in long Phase 0 sessions, causing Brain to write the plan and execute the implementation directly under Opus 4.7. Hybrid fix: (a) `commands/brain.md` reinforced with an explicit override clause, concrete `Task`-tool dispatch templates at the top of each Phase, a self-check guard, phase-boundary reinforcement, and a negative-examples block; (b) a per-turn guard block at `agents-md-block/orchestra-guard.md` injected by `deploy.sh` into `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` between sentinels `<!-- ORCHESTRA_GUARD_START -->` / `<!-- ORCHESTRA_GUARD_END -->`. The AGENTS.md guard is the load-bearing component because it loads on every turn (parallel to plan-mode's reminder cadence), while `/brain.md` reinforcement makes the command body self-coherent. Cost overhead is < 5% of typical /brain session due to prompt caching of stable system-prompt content.

**`/duo-plan` setup-bash override (2026-05-06):** the same plan-mode override conflict affects `/duo-plan`'s setup phase: plan-mode's "MUST NOT run non-readonly tools" clause suppressed the refusal-check and session-dir-creation bash calls, meaning `.duo-inflight` was never written, /duo mode never activated, and the session ran as plain plan mode + direct edits. Fix: `commands/duo-plan.md` now opens with a prominent `PLAN-MODE OVERRIDE` callout at line 11, before `## When to use /duo vs /brain`, explicitly exempting the setup bash calls (lifecycle management, not code edits) from the plan-mode restriction.

When NOT to use /brain: simple tasks with ≤5 steps, low blast radius. Use /duo instead.

## How the workflow works

### Agents

| Agent | Model | File | Tools | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Brain** | Anthropic Opus 4.7 recommended (any model permitted; advisory only) | — (main session) | all | Orchestrates; calls `ExitPlanMode` at plan approval (G2). Strictly speaking Brain is not an "agent" — it's the parent session itself; included here as the top of the tier hierarchy. |
| **Planner** | `claude-code-glm-5.1` | `~/.config/opencode/agent/planner.md` | Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, TodoWrite (read-only) | Decomposes task into numbered plan; Brain persists to PLAN.md |
| **Actor** | `claude-code-qwen3-coder-next` | `~/.config/opencode/agent/actor.md` | Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob (+ denies on rm -rf, git push) | Executes one step per invocation; self-persists TASKS.json via atomic-rename |
| **Actor** (heavy) | `claude-code-kimi-k2.6` | `~/.config/opencode/agent/actor-heavy.md` | Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob (+ denies on rm -rf, git push) | Complex multi-file refactors; triggered by `[tier: heavy]` step annotations |
| **Reviewer** | `claude-code-kimi-k2.6` | `~/.config/opencode/agent/reviewer.md` | Read, Grep, Glob, TodoWrite (read-only) | Reviews diff against PLAN.md; returns PASS / FIX / BLOCK |

### Model requirements

| Command | Minimum | Recommended | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/brain` | none | Anthropic Opus 4.7 | **Advisory only** — Brain emits a one-line notice on non-Opus models and continues. Any model is permitted. |
| `/duo` | none | claude-code-kimi-k2.6 | Advisory only — Brain warns and continues |

The check happens at command startup before any Bash or setup runs. It is LLM-enforced (Brain reads "The exact model ID is…" injected by OpenCode into every session's system context) — same trust level as the plan-mode gate.

**Why Anthropic Opus 4.7 is recommended for `/brain`.** Brain's job is multi-turn interrogation, plan reasoning over a large session context, dispatch decisions, and review judgment across the cap-3 loop. These all reward strong reasoning, and the cost is small (Brain is one session per pipeline, not per step). The pipeline subagents — Planner, Actor, Actor-Heavy, Reviewer — deliberately use non-Anthropic models because their work is per-step, narrow-context, and benefits more from the SoHoAI flat-rate economics than from incremental reasoning quality.

**Deliberate deviation from `claude-orchestra`.** The upstream `claude-orchestra` project enforces this as a hard gate (STOPs on Haiku, older Sonnet, or non-Anthropic models). `oconona` deliberately downgrades the check to advisory only — the operator's model choice is final, and any model can drive `/brain`. The recommendation is preserved (notice emitted on non-Opus) but never blocks.

### Sequential Phase Architecture & gates

| Phase | Gate before | Policy | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 RESEARCH | PLAN | skip | Brain interrogates operator inline (Brain only, not separate agent) |
| 1 PLAN | IMPLEMENT | **approve (required)** | **`ExitPlanMode` called by Brain — NOT by Planner** |
| 2 IMPLEMENT | REVIEW | follow permission mode | Standard OpenCode approval UX per tool |
| 3 REVIEW | LOOP/DONE | **auto-loop, cap 3** | Brain counts; surfaces PASS/FIX/BLOCK verdict |

RESEARCH is served by Brain itself (with user input) or by built-in `Explore` subagent. No dedicated Researcher agent in v1.

### Autonomy presets

Two presets fully wired in v1; third is a stub:

| Preset | Permission mode | Review loop | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `default` | default (per-edit prompts) | auto-loop cap 3 | all interactive work; user reviews each edit |
| `acceptEdits` | bypassPermissions (no prompts) | auto-loop cap 3 | low-risk tasks; full automation of edits |
| `auto` (v2 stub) | bypassPermissions | checkpoint commits + CROSS-CHECK + test gate | unattended runs; NOT implemented in v1 |

No `/orchestra-mode` command in v1 (`auto` is deferred to v2).

## Design details

### Hooks

Five hook types in `~/.config/opencode/settings.json`, dispatching to `~/.config/opencode/scripts/orchestra-hook.sh`:

1. **PreToolUse(Agent)** — `start` mode. Logs subagent invocation to invocations.log.
2. **SubagentStop** — `end` mode. Logs subagent completion.
3. **PreCompact** — `compact` mode. Saves `brain-state.md` (plan/task/decision snapshot for resumption post-`/clear`).
4. **Stop** — `stop` mode (safety net). Fires at the end of **every response turn** (not only on process exit). Walks session_dirs that have no `telemetry.json` **and** no inflight marker — i.e., sessions where cleanup already started (inflight markers removed by `/duo-act`/`/duo-abandon`/`/brain`) but `telemetry-summarize.sh` failed to write `telemetry.json`. Gate (updated 2026-05-06): skip if `.duo-inflight` or `.brain-inflight` is present (session still in-progress — removing the marker here would destroy the badge and cause `NO_SESSION` errors on the next refinement turn); then check for artefacts (`PLAN.md`, `RESEARCH.md`, `telemetry-events.jsonl`). Writes `.outcome=abandoned` before invoking the summariser (mtime bounds the T2 window), and resets `state.env` when finalising a /brain session so the badge clears. Inflight marker removal is the exclusive responsibility of `/duo-act`, `/duo-abandon`, and `/brain`/`/brain-abandon` cleanup.
5. (No tool-call hooks; subagent tool dispatch is opaque by design.)

### Status line

The OpenCode status line is extended by `status-line/orchestra-block.sh`, injected into `~/.config/opencode/scripts/status-line.sh` at deploy time via the `# ORCHESTRA_BLOCK_START` / `# ORCHESTRA_BLOCK_END` sentinels.

#### What it displays

The orchestra block produces a **full status line layout** (not just a badge). It replaces the OC-native progress bar and token-count fields and inserts its own fields immediately after the model name:

```
model | ctx ▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 21% 210K/1M | ~$X.YZ | ◆ project | ⎇ branch | [♪ badge]
```

Fields injected by the orchestra block:

**`ctx`** — context window utilization (always shown). Colored 20-cell bar (1 cell = 5%), percentage, and token usage. Example: `ctx ▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 12% 24K/200K` (green). Color thresholds:
- **Green**: < 50% utilization
- **Yellow**: 50–79% utilization
- **Orange**: ≥ 80% utilization

The utilization denominator is looked up from `context-windows.yaml` per model ID, with fallback to OpenCode's native `context_window.context_window_size`. Model ID normalization strips `[1m]`, `[200k]`, and date suffixes before lookup. Models with `[1m]` in their ID force a 1,000,000 denominator.

**Non-Anthropic models (`claude-code-*`).** OpenCode does not report token counts for non-Anthropic models (e.g. `claude-code-kimi-k2.6`). A SoHoAI fallback reaches into `usage_events` via `query_sohoai_usage()` in `scripts/telemetry-summarize.py` and `sohoai-live-cost.sh`. Key constraints:
- **Latest request only**: the fallback reads `latest_total_tokens` (size of the most recent API request), NOT cumulative tokens across all turns — cumulative would produce absurd percentages (14M/256K ≈ 5500%).
- **Model-scoped**: query uses `model = ? OR model LIKE ?` (e.g. `kimi-k2.6` matches `kimi-k2.6:cloud` in the DB). Source filter is intentionally omitted because SoHoAI's LiteLLM callback tags non-Anthropic models with `source='unknown'`.
- **Time-scoped**: `created_at >=` from the `.lck` `started_at` field isolates this session's requests from other concurrent or prior sessions with the same model.
- **Denominator consistency**: percentage and display both use `context-windows.yaml` as the denominator. Without this fix OC's `context_window_size` for non-Anthropic models would report ~200K for a 256K-window model, inflating the percentage to 101%.
- **TTL**: 8 s, so the token bar updates every ~8 s rather than continuously (sufficient for a progress indicator).

**`~$X.YZ`** — live running cost (always shown, including `~$0.00` from the very first render so the display is visibly live from session start). Source differs by session type:
- **Orchestra sessions**: SoHoAI `usage_events` table query via SQLite direct read (primary, NFS-accessible) or HTTP API fallback (TTL=8 s cache). Stale cache marked `*`. No `(est)` fallback — JSONL is not used (SoHoAI-proxied sessions do not write `costUSD` to JSONL entries).
- **Native sessions (no recent orchestra)**: `cost.total_cost_usd` from OC's own `statusLine` JSON input — precise, always current, no external query needed. Last non-zero total (parent + subagents) is written to `active-sessions/<session>.cost-cache` (atomic rename); when OC reports 0 at tool-call turn boundaries the cached value is shown instead, keeping the field continuously visible.
- **Native sessions (after orchestra session ends in same project)**: `cost_usd_estimate` from the most recent `telemetry.json`, shown instead of the CC JSON estimate — authoritative (SoHoAI subagents + T2 parent). Guard: `telemetry.json` mtime must be strictly greater than the native session's `.lck` mtime (proves the pipeline ended *during* this session, not before). If the `.lck` does not exist yet (`mtime=0`), falls back to CC JSON. This prevents false positives when a new session is opened after an orchestra session ends.

**`♪ badge`** — orchestra session badge (shown only during active /duo or /brain sessions, or when a subagent is running). Badge formats in descending priority:

| Condition | Badge |
|---|---|
| `/duo` session active (one) | `♪ orchestra -> plan <title>  [▶ stage]` |
| `/duo` sessions active (many) | `♪ orchestra -> plan #N` |
| `/brain` session active | `♪ orchestra -> brain <title>  [▶ stage]` |
| Subagent running (no /brain or /duo context) | `♪ orchestra  ▶ stage` |
| No orchestra activity | *(nothing — orchestra block is silent for badge)* |

#### When it updates

The status line script is called by OpenCode on each render tick — after every model turn and when tool calls are shown in the UI. **The active-subagent indicator (`▶ stage`) appears in real-time**: the `PreToolUse(Agent)` hook writes the `start` event to `invocations.log` *before* the Task tool executes, so the indicator is already present by the time the subagent begins running.

#### Data sources

| Signal | Source | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `/duo` title and inflight state | `${SESSION_DIR}/.duo-inflight` | `/duo-plan` command setup |
| `/brain` title and mode | `~/.config/opencode/orchestra/state.env` (`ORCHESTRA_MODE=brain`, `ORCHESTRA_TITLE=…`) | `/brain` command setup |
| `/brain` inflight marker (session-discovery for `/brain-abandon` and explicit CMD-classification by Stop-hook) | `${SESSION_DIR}/.brain-inflight` | `/brain` command setup |
| Active subagent stage | `~/.config/opencode/orchestra/invocations.log` (last `start` event with no matching `end`) | `orchestra-hook.sh start` (PreToolUse) |
| Live cost (orchestra) | SoHoAI `usage_events` SQLite (direct) → HTTP API fallback via `sohoai-live-cost.sh` (TTL=8 s) | T2 via SoHoAI API |
| Live cost (native) | `cost.total_cost_usd` from CC `statusLine` JSON input | CC accumulates cost internally |
| Live cost (ctx segment) | `context_windows.yaml` + CC context width | ctx-segment.sh |

#### ctx segment implementation details

The ctx segment uses `scripts/ctx-segment.sh` which reads `context-windows.yaml` from `~/.config/opencode/orchestra/`. Model ID normalisation strips `[1m]`, `[200k]`, and `-YYYYMMDD` suffixes before lookup. If the original ID contains `[1m]`, the denominator is forced to 1,000,000 regardless of the map entry.

Bar: 20 cells, each representing 5% of the context window (filled `▓`, empty `░`). Prior to 2026-05-12 the bar was 10 cells at 10% each; prior to 2026-05-11 it was 8 cells at 12.5% each.

Token formatting: values ≥ 1,000,000 show as `XM` (e.g., `1.2M`), values ≥ 1,000 show as `XK`, otherwise raw `XK`.

#### CC statusLine JSON schema (CC 2.1.139+)

CC passes a rich JSON object to the `statusLine` command on every render. Key fields used by the orchestra block:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `session_id` | string | CC session UUID — used directly for native cost display; no `.lck` check |
| `transcript_path` | string | Absolute path to this session's JSONL transcript |
| `session_name` | string | Human-readable session name (set via `/rename`) |
| `cost.total_cost_usd` | float | Precise accumulated session cost (all subagents included) |
| `model.id` / `model.display_name` | string | Model identifier and display name |
| `context_window.*` | object | Token counts and utilization percentage |
| `workspace.current_dir` | string | Session working directory |
| `version` | string | CC version string |

`session_id` identifies the native session for cost display directly — no `.lck` file check. The `.lck` is only for session finalization (Stop hook → `native-session-finalize.py` → T2 record); removing it from the cost gate fixes resumed sessions (Stop hook removes the old lck at end of each turn; no new lck until the first Bash call). `cost.total_cost_usd` is used as the live cost — precise, always current, no SoHoAI query needed.

#### SoHoAI live cost (orchestra sessions only)

SoHoAI cost for orchestra sessions is retrieved via `scripts/sohoai-live-cost.sh`:

**Primary: SQLite direct read**
- Reads `usage_events` table from SoHoAI's SQLite DB at `sohoai.db_path` in `config.yaml` (or `SOHOAI_DB_PATH` env var)
- Query: `SELECT SUM(cost_usd) FROM usage_events WHERE orchestra_session_id = ?`
- No time filter needed — `orchestra_session_id` uniquely identifies the session
- Instant (<5 ms), no HTTP overhead, no timeout risk
- Returns the running accumulated cost (same data as SoHoAI HTTP API)

**Fallback: SoHoAI HTTP API**
- Fires only when SQLite DB is unavailable/unconfigured
- `started_at` is derived from `.transcript-path` mtime (written once at session init), NOT from the passed `started_at_unix` (which is the session dir mtime — updated on every file write, effectively always near-now, which caused the original oscillation)
- 1s timeout; stale cache returned with trailing `*` on failure

**Why `costUSD` JSONL is not used**
Sessions routed through SoHoAI proxy do not receive a `costUSD` field in JSONL entries (CC only writes this when calling Anthropic directly). Token-based estimation from pricing.yaml overcounts by ~55% because SoHoAI/LiteLLM applies different effective cache_read rates. The SQLite DB contains SoHoAI's own billing records and is the authoritative source.

**TTL**: 8 s (cache hit < 50 ms). Stale cache marked `*`.

Native sessions bypass this path entirely and use `cost.total_cost_usd` from the JSON input instead.

Model ID lookup in `context-windows.yaml` uses:
- Primary: exact `model.id` match
- Fallback: `display_name` (lowercase, hyphenated, sans parentheses)

#### Deploy / portability

`status-line/orchestra-block.sh` is a **portable standalone snippet** — it defines its own color variables so it can be dropped into any host status-line script. `deploy.sh` strips the old block and re-injects the current source whenever the two diverge, making status-line updates idempotent.

### NFS / cross-machine

All state at `~/.config/opencode/` is shared via NFS symlink (`~/.config/opencode → /mnt/nfs/Florian/Gin-AI/.claude`), so agents and config are instantly visible on all Debian hosts.

Per-project state (`PLAN.md`, `TASKS.json`, logs) lives at `${OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR}/.opencode/orchestra/sessions/<UTC-timestamp>-<PID>/` — per-invocation isolation.

Concurrency safety via hostname + PID + timestamp stamping in log lines; atomic-rename for state files; no lock sentinel in v1.

### Cost model — SoHoAI flat-rate

All subagents operate under a flat-rate SoHoAI subscription (marginal cost = $0 per invocation):

- **Brain** (Anthropic Opus 4.7): most expensive; receives every subagent's return. Brain is per-token Anthropic pricing (NOT flat-rate SoHoAI). Mitigated by prompt caching + `PreCompact` hook saving state. Cost dominates a typical session.
- **Planner** (claude-code-glm-5.1): called once per plan. $0 marginal cost.
- **Actor** (claude-code-qwen3-coder-next or claude-code-kimi-k2.6 if heavy): called once per step. $0 marginal cost.
- **Reviewer** (claude-code-kimi-k2.6): called once per review (up to 3 per step). $0 marginal cost.

Rule of thumb: use `/brain` for tasks where the review loop actually earns the Brain overhead (architecture, multi-file refactors). Use `/duo` for simple, low-risk tasks. The zero-marginal-cost subagents make both pipelines economically viable even with repeated review iterations.

### Disabling and troubleshooting

**Global disable**: `mv ~/.config/opencode/scripts/orchestra-hook.sh{,.bak}` (intentionally loud; next `opencode` invocation will fail visibly).

**Full uninstall**: `rm -rf ~/.config/opencode/agent/{planner,actor,actor-heavy,reviewer}.md ~/.config/opencode/command/{brain,duo}.md ~/.config/opencode/scripts/orchestra-hook.sh ~/.config/opencode/orchestra/`, then edit `~/.config/opencode/settings.json` to remove hook entries.

Quick-ref troubleshooting:

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Status-line badge doesn't appear | `config.yaml` missing or `cwd` unset in status-line input | `ls ~/.config/opencode/orchestra/config.yaml`; run `status-line.sh` manually with test JSON |
| `PLAN.md` garbled | Atomic-rename not used — direct write instead | Inspect for `.tmp` sibling; check Planner prompt |
| `/brain` command unrecognised | `~/.config/opencode/commands/brain.md` missing or malformed | `/help` lists commands; inspect file frontmatter |
| `.last-logfile.*` files accumulating in `orchestra/` | Old bug: sidecar used PID of hook process so `end` could never find and delete `start`'s file | Fixed: sidecar now lives in session dir (shared path for start and end); stale files auto-cleaned after 120 min at hook startup |
| `logs/*.log` growing unbounded | No rotation | Auto-rotated at hook startup: files older than 30 days deleted |
| `~$X.YZ` cost never appears | T1 hook not writing to `telemetry-events.jsonl` | Check `orchestra-hook.sh` is executable and wired in `settings.json` |

### Deviations from canonical OpenCode

Aligned with canonical:
- Subagent definitions (`.opencode/agent/*.md` with frontmatter)
- Hooks (`PreToolUse`, `SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`)
- Permission modes (`default` / `acceptEdits` / `plan` / `bypassPermissions`)
- Slash commands (`.opencode/command/*.md`)
- Plan approval via `ExitPlanMode`

Deliberate deviations:
- **Custom state dir `.opencode/orchestra/`** — pragmatic co-location with other OpenCode config.
- **Per-invocation subdirs** — isolation and lazy cleanup (30-day retention).
- **Atomic-rename pattern** — POSIX standard, documented in prompts, not enforced at hook level.
- **SoHoAI model aliases** — `claude-code-glm-5.1`, `claude-code-qwen3-coder-next`, `claude-code-kimi-k2.6` (alias stability governed by §Multi-model routing).

### Live feed limitations

Hooks fire at tool-call boundaries only. They capture *what the subagent is doing* (Edit/Write/Bash calls) but **not** *why* (thinking blocks) or *what it sees* (tool results). Full live feed would require a OpenCode streaming hook (not available in v1) or subagents running as separate `claude -p` processes (Option A, rejected in favor of simplicity).

See design-history.md §13.3 for three potential approaches to close the gap.

## Telemetry

### Rationale

Multi-tier orchestration has a non-obvious cost structure. Brain (Anthropic Opus 4.7) dominates by token volume — it re-sends its full context every turn (cached after the first hit, but still billed at the cache-read rate of the most expensive model) and receives all subagent returns. Planner (claude-code-glm-5.1) and Reviewer (claude-code-kimi-k2.6) are single-call-per-phase. Actor (claude-code-qwen3-coder-next) is called once per step and may iterate. Without measurement, cost/quality trade-offs are guesses: which tier to change? which phase to skip? does the built-in `Explore` subagent justify a dedicated cheaper Researcher agent? Telemetry makes those decisions data-driven (see `TODO.md §0` for the full decision-gate framework).

Every `/brain` and `/duo` run is instrumented post-hoc by `scripts/telemetry-summarize.{sh,py}`, invoked from each command's cleanup block. Native (non-orchestra) CC sessions are tracked automatically via `bash-session-init.sh` (sourced on every Bash tool call through `BASH_ENV`) and finalized by the Stop hook — see §Native session tracking below.

Two complementary approaches cover the full cost picture. They are tried in priority order; the first to return a non-zero value is used.

---

### Approach 1 — Local JSONL (T1 + T2 hybrid)

**Prerequisite:** works with **any** Anthropic API endpoint — direct or proxied — as long as JSONL transcripts are written locally by OpenCode under `~/.config/opencode/projects/`. No proxy required.

#### How it works

Two layers instrument every orchestra session:

**T1 — hook-based, real-time.** `orchestra-hook.sh` appends one JSON event per subagent dispatch / completion to `${SESSION_DIR}/telemetry-events.jsonl`. Captures subagent type, timing, and stage identity. Token counts are always `null` (hook payloads do not expose them). T1 drives the live `~$X.YZ` status-line badge.

**T2 — transcript parsing, authoritative.** Runs once at cleanup. `telemetry-summarize.py` walks all `*.jsonl` files in the project's transcripts directory whose records fall within the session time window — capturing content split across multiple JSONLs by `--fork-session` or `/clear`-induced UUID rotation. For each in-window parent JSONL, it walks `<uuid>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl` (subagent transcripts), attributed via `agent-*.meta.json` sidecars (`{"agentType": "…"}`). Token counts accumulate across all contributing JSONLs; USD cost is computed via the cost-source cascade (see §Cost-source cascade).

T2 writes:
- `${SESSION_DIR}/telemetry.json` — rich per-session record: parent + subagent tokens per tier, USD cost estimate (`cost_usd_estimate` = `subagent_cost_usd` + `parent_cost_usd` when source is SoHoAI), iteration counts, outcome, `cost_source`, `parser_warnings`.
- `~/.config/opencode/orchestra/telemetry.jsonl` — global append-only trend log; one line per session (includes `session_dir` for cross-project lookup).
- T2 supersedes T1 for all cost figures.

**T2 time window:** `[started_at, ended_at]`. `started_at` is parsed from the session-dir basename (`<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>-<PID>`). `ended_at` is the mtime of `${SESSION_DIR}/.outcome` when present, falling back to `time.time()`. All exit paths — `/duo-act`, `/duo-abandon`, `/brain` cleanup (all verdicts), `/brain-abandon`, and the Stop-hook safety net — write `.outcome` before invoking the summariser. This makes the window deterministic and re-runs of the summariser idempotent (the window does not expand to "now").

**Safety net:** the `Stop` hook runs T2 on session dirs where cleanup started (inflight markers already removed) but `telemetry.json` was never written. Sessions that still have `.duo-inflight` or `.brain-inflight` are skipped — they are in-progress.

---

### Native session tracking

Native (non-orchestra) CC sessions are tracked via a two-step mechanism that avoids the need for any per-request header or proxy instrumentation.

**Registration — `scripts/bash-session-init.sh` (sourced via `BASH_ENV`).**
OpenCode sets `OC_SESSION_ID` in the environment of every Bash tool call, but not in hook subprocesses. `bash-session-init.sh` exploits this: it is sourced automatically at the start of each Bash tool call (via `BASH_ENV=/home/florian/.config/opencode/scripts/bash-session-init.sh` in `settings.json`). On the first call it writes a `.lck` file to `~/.config/opencode/active-sessions/native-<UUID>.lck` containing:

```
cc_pid=<stable-claude-PID>
session_id=native-<UUID>
started_at=<ISO8601>
session_uuid=<UUID>
```

`cc_pid` is the stable top-level `opencode` process — found by checking if `$PPID.comm == "opencode"` (normal case) or walking one level up (if PPID is a transient node subprocess). The script is a no-op for subsequent calls (file already exists) and skips orchestra sessions (`.brain-inflight` / `.duo-inflight` present — handled by orchestra telemetry instead). The UUID serves as the primary key; the PID is stored solely for liveness detection.

**Status-line identification.** The `statusLine` command subprocess does not receive `OC_SESSION_ID` as an env var (unlike Bash tool call subprocesses). Session identification for the live cost display uses `session_id` from the OC `statusLine` JSON input instead — no PID walking, no env vars. See §CC statusLine JSON schema.

**Finalization — `scripts/orchestra-hook.sh` stop mode.**
The Stop hook fires per response turn. It iterates all `native-*.lck` files and for each runs `kill -0 <cc_pid>`. If the process is dead the session has ended: it invokes `native-session-finalize.py` (T2 cost attribution via the cost-source cascade) and removes the `.lck`. Since `OC_SESSION_ID` is not available in hook context, finalization of session N is triggered by the Stop hook of session N+1 — typically within seconds of the user opening a new session. Edge case: if no new session is opened after session N ends, the `.lck` persists until the next CC session starts. `session-report.py` guards against this by calling `os.kill(cc_pid, 0)` in `load_active_native_sessions()` and silently skipping any stale entry whose process is already dead.

**Re-finalization and dedup (2026-05-12).** `native-session-finalize.py` writes atomically via a `.tmp` rename and strips any prior record for the same `session_id` before writing, so a re-run (e.g. manual finalize followed by a Stop-hook finalize) produces exactly one authoritative record. `session-report.py`'s `load_native_telemetry()` additionally deduplicates on read (last record per `session_id` wins) as a safety net for records written before this fix.

**Cross-source dedup — orchestra-parent suppression (2026-05-14).** When `/brain` or `/duo` runs, the parent CC process registers as a native session (via `bash-session-init.sh`) AND is finalized as an orchestra session. Both have the same `started_at` timestamp (the orchestra session ID encodes the start time; `bash-session-init.sh` records the same value in the `.lck`). Two fixes prevent double-counting:
- `native-session-finalize.py` skips writing a native record if `started_at` already appears in `~/.config/opencode/orchestra/telemetry.jsonl` — prevents future duplicates from accumulating in source files.
- `session-report.py` filters out native records whose `started_at` matches any orchestra record at display time — retroactively fixes historical duplicates already in the JSONL files.
`session-report.py`'s `load_orchestra_telemetry()` also deduplicates by `session_id` (last record wins), mirroring the same pattern in `load_native_telemetry()`.

**Session IDs.** Native session IDs written by `bash-session-init.sh` are `native-<UUID>` (e.g. `native-6dedcd3d-37e5-46a9-958e-fb0a822b5e3a`). The UUID is the CC session UUID (`OC_SESSION_ID`), making IDs globally unique and stable. Older sessions (before the UUID-keyed registration refactor, 2026-05-07) used a `native-<timestamp>-<PID>` format; both formats are stored in `~/.config/opencode/native-sessions/telemetry.jsonl` and handled by the report scripts.

**Telemetry record fields** (written to `~/.config/opencode/native-sessions/telemetry.jsonl`):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `session_id` | `native-<UUID>` |
| `command` | always `"native"` |
| `started_at` | ISO8601 timestamp from `.lck` creation |
| `ended_at` | ISO8601 timestamp at finalization |
| `duration_s` | wall-clock seconds |
| `cost_usd_estimate` | parent + all subagent costs (from cost-source cascade); `0.0` for non-Anthropic (zero-rate) models |
| `cost_source` | `sohoai_api` / `litellm` / `pricing_yaml` / `none` |
| `model` | parent session model name (present when transcript was parsed — both Anthropic and non-Anthropic) |
| `total_tokens` | parent session token count (present when transcript was parsed; excludes subagent tokens) |

**Non-Anthropic models.** Sessions using SoHoAI proxy models not in `pricing.yaml` (e.g. `claude-code-qwen3-coder-next`, `claude-code-kimi-k2.6`) are recorded with `cost_usd_estimate: 0.0` and `cost_source: "pricing_yaml"` — the transcript was successfully parsed and the model identified, but no pricing rate is available. `session-report.py` renders these as `$0.0000` to distinguish them from sessions where cost attribution failed entirely (`cost_source: "none"`, displayed as `-`). For past records already in `telemetry.jsonl` with a missing `model` field (written before the 2026-05-11 finalize-script fix), `session-report.py` retroactively re-reads the JSONL transcript at display time to fill in the model name.

**Reporting.** `native-session-report.py` reads from two sources and merges them (deduplicating by `session_id`, telemetry takes precedence, sorted newest-first):
1. `~/.config/opencode/native-sessions/telemetry.jsonl` — primary; contains all sessions finalized since 2026-05-07.
2. `~/.config/opencode/usage-data/session-meta/*.json` — legacy; populated by CC < 2.1 (April 2026 and earlier); no longer updated by CC 2.1.132.

For sessions with a `native-<UUID>` session ID, the report also looks up the transcript JSONL to obtain per-type token breakdown and project name. For old-format `native-<timestamp>-<PID>` sessions, `total_tokens` from the telemetry record is used directly and project name shows as `native`. `session-report.py` (unified report) applies the same project-name lookup for native sessions, using `*.project-name` sidecar files and NFS path unmangling. `native-session-report.py` defaults to 20 sessions when no date filter is given; when `--since` or `--month` is active and `--last` is not explicitly set, no cap is applied (all matching sessions are shown).

**Requirement.** `BASH_ENV=/home/florian/.opencode/scripts/bash-session-init.sh` must be set in `settings.json` env. This is **not** managed by `deploy.sh` — it must be set manually or persisted in `settings.json`. Without it, `bash-session-init.sh` is never sourced and no `.lck` is written; native sessions appear as `cost_source: "none"` with zero cost.

### Approach 2 — SoHoAI proxy (LiteLLM)

**Prerequisite:** API calls must be routed through the [SoHoAI](https://sohoai.org) LiteLLM proxy (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` set to the SoHoAI endpoint). Without this, the SoHoAI API query returns nothing and the system falls back to Approach 1 cost calculation transparently.

#### How it works

SoHoAI tracks cost per API call server-side, attributed by a session header injected into every outbound request. Each `/brain` and `/duo` command writes `X-Orchestra-Session-ID: <session-id>` to `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` in `~/.config/opencode/settings.local.json` at session setup, and removes it at cleanup (atomic `tmp + mv -f` to prevent corruption). The header value is the session-dir basename (e.g. `20260507T101953Z-1971495`). For native sessions, `otel-headers-helper.sh` is configured to inject a `native-<UUID>` header, but is not called by CC 2.1.132 — native session cost attribution falls back to T2 (`pricing_yaml`).

At T2 cleanup, `telemetry-summarize.py` queries:

```
GET {ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL}/v1/usage/stats?session_id=<ID>&since=<ISO8601>&until=<ISO8601>
```

with a ±60s buffer around the session time window. If SoHoAI returns a non-zero `totals.cost_usd`, that value is used as the **subagent cost** and `cost_source` is set to `"sohoai_api+t2_parent"`. The parent Brain's cost (not visible to SoHoAI — see below) is computed from the T2 JSONL token counts using `pricing.yaml` and added to the SoHoAI subagent figure. Both components are stored in `telemetry.json` as `subagent_cost_usd` and `parent_cost_usd`; `cost_usd_estimate` is their sum. If pricing.yaml is unavailable the parent component is zero and `cost_source` falls back to `"sohoai_api"`. Otherwise the system falls back to litellm or pricing.yaml (see §Cost-source cascade).

For native sessions, `native-session-finalize.py` performs the same SoHoAI query at finalization time. In practice (CC 2.1.132), SoHoAI returns zero for native sessions (no header injected), so cost attribution falls back to `pricing_yaml`. The result is written to `~/.config/opencode/native-sessions/telemetry.jsonl`.

**Why SoHoAI misses the parent Brain cost.** `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` (which carries `X-Orchestra-Session-ID`) is written to `settings.local.json` by the session setup block. The parent Brain process reads settings at startup — before the setup block executes — so the parent's own API calls go to SoHoAI *without* the session header. Subagents are spawned after the header is written and inherit it correctly. The T2 parent cost augmentation (above) compensates for this gap.

#### Inspecting per-session data

```bash
# Check which cost source was used for a specific orchestra session
cat ~/.config/opencode/orchestra/sessions/<session-id>/telemetry.json | jq '{cost_usd_estimate, cost_source}'

# Check cost source across all finalized native sessions
cat ~/.config/opencode/native-sessions/telemetry.jsonl | jq '{session_id, cost_source}'

# Distribution of cost sources across orchestra sessions
grep -o '"cost_source":"[^"]*"' ~/.config/opencode/orchestra/telemetry.jsonl | sort | uniq -c

# Confirm the active-sessions header is set (during an orchestra session)
cat ~/.config/opencode/settings.local.json | jq .env.ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS
```

#### Summary reports

Both the unified and orchestra-specific reports show a `Source` column (`sohoai_api` | `litellm` | `pricing_yaml` | `none`) so you can see which cost path was used at a glance:

```bash
# Unified report with Source column
~/.config/opencode/scripts/session-report.sh --last 10

# Orchestra-only report with Source column
~/.config/opencode/scripts/telemetry-report.sh --last 10

# Filter to native sessions only (finalized via SoHoAI where available)
~/.config/opencode/scripts/session-report.sh --source native --last 10

# Scope to a date range
~/.config/opencode/scripts/session-report.sh --since 2026-05-01
~/.config/opencode/scripts/session-report.sh --month 2026-05
```

---

### Cost-source cascade

T2 applies sources in priority order; first non-zero value wins:

| Priority | Source | `cost_source` value | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | SoHoAI API + T2 parent | `"sohoai_api+t2_parent"` | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` set; SoHoAI returns non-zero; pricing.yaml provides parent rate |
| 1a | SoHoAI API only | `"sohoai_api"` | SoHoAI returns non-zero; pricing.yaml unavailable (parent cost = 0) |
| 2 | litellm | `"litellm"` | litellm installed; `completion_cost()` returns non-zero for session models |
| 3 | pricing.yaml | `"pricing_yaml"` | `config/pricing.yaml` present with model rates |
| — | none (0.0) | `"none"` | All three unavailable or return zero |

`pricing.yaml` carries a `last_updated` field. `telemetry-report.sh` warns if rates are > 90 days stale; bump manually after verifying against https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/all-models.

**Caveats:**
- Per-session `telemetry.json` is the authoritative source (T2). The global `telemetry.jsonl` stores totals only.
- `OC_SESSION_ID` is not set in subprocess environments (all hook invocations show `session: "unknown"`). `OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR` is set in hook subprocesses but not in Bash tool call subprocesses. All three places that compute a project path (`orchestra-hook.sh`, `duo.md`, `brain.md`) normalize with `realpath` to resolve symlinks to the physical NFS path.
- T2 transcript discovery uses `.transcript-path` (stored at session-dir creation) as primary, and a global `~/.config/opencode/projects/*/` scan as secondary. No hardcoded path remains.

### Per-tier cost interpretation

**Typical tier proportions:**

These are historical examples from the Anthropic-only era. For current non-Anthropic deployments, see the SoHoAI flat-rate cost model (§Cost model — SoHoAI flat-rate) and per-tier breakdown command (`telemetry-report.sh --tier`).

**Sample tier proportions from historical /brain sessions:**

| Session type | Brain | Planner | Actor | Reviewer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/brain` | variable | ~13% | ~8% | ~13% |
| `/duo` | ~60% | — | ~40% | — |

Models: Brain (Anthropic Opus 4.7), Planner (claude-code-glm-5.1), Actor (claude-code-qwen3-coder-next, or claude-code-kimi-k2.6 for heavy steps), Reviewer (claude-code-kimi-k2.6). All subagents operate under flat-rate SoHoAI pricing (marginal cost = $0); Brain is per-token Anthropic pricing.

Brain's tier dominance is what remains **after** prompt caching has already taken ~86% off Brain's bill — the proportions in the table are post-cache. Three multipliers stack to keep Brain on top: **model rate** (Brain pays per-token Anthropic pricing; subagents run on SoHoAI flat-rate), **context size** (Brain re-sends the whole session every turn; subagents get a fresh, scoped prompt), and **turn count** (Brain runs every user message + every dispatch round-trip; subagents are one-shot). Caching only attacks the first multiplier. To shift the proportions further: trim context (`/compact`, smaller inlined artifacts) or downgrade the Brain model.

The `--tier` flag on `telemetry-report.sh` reads per-session `telemetry.json` files (located via the `session_dir` field in the global log) to produce a per-tier breakdown for each session, then a cumulative totals table across all sessions — the primary tool for answering "which tier is driving my costs overall?".

**Sample `--tier` output:**

```
  2026-05-20  brain   560s  outcome=pass  total=~$0.02

  TOTAL                                 2,901,485          ~$0.0600
```

**Decision gates** (see `TODO.md §0` for thresholds and sample-size requirements):

1. **Researcher agent** — implement only if `Explore` dispatches account for > 15% of session cost.
2. **Planner model** — downgrade to a cheaper model only if `planner_replans` rate is low and Planner cost fraction is measurable.
3. **1-hour TTL caching** — activate per-tier when TTL-miss rate exceeds 33%.
4. **Reviewer skip** — only if FIX-verdict rate drops below 10% over ≥ 50 sessions (quality risk).
5. **Opus vs Sonnet for Brain** — compare `regret_flag` rate at different model tiers once sufficient data exists.

## Multi-model routing (SoHoAI graduated rollout)

### Rationale: from marginal cost to flat-rate pricing

Prior to May 2026, multi-model routing in the orchestra was rejected based on a per-token marginal cost model: switching from Sonnet to a cheaper tier would save money linearly. The analysis assumed all cost differences flowed to the operator. Under that assumption, tiering complexity was not justified.

Ollama Cloud Pro changed the equation: it operates on a **flat-rate subscription model** rather than per-token billing. This means the marginal cost of a Planner replan or an Actor redo is now zero (within the subscription cap), while the **quality risk** of using an untested model remains real. The decision matrix inverted: we now optimize for **quality and capability per subscription dollar**, not token efficiency.

Reference: [Design history & amendments](design-history.md) §Amendment 2026-05-10 — this section documents the decision; see `design-history.md` for the historical context.

### Model assignments and tier annotations

| Role | Model | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Planner (normal) | `claude-code-glm-5.1` | all inputs |
| Actor (default) | `claude-code-qwen3-coder-next` | all steps unless marked heavy |
| Actor (heavy) | `claude-code-kimi-k2.6` | `[tier: heavy]` annotation in PLAN.md step |
| Reviewer | `claude-code-kimi-k2.6` | all reviews (calibration + flat-rate economics) |

**Brain** is recommended on Anthropic Opus 4.7 (advisory only — any model permitted; see §Model requirements above). `/duo` is unconstrained and recommends claude-code-kimi-k2.6 advisory; any model works for `/duo`.

### Step-level tier annotations

Plan steps may be tagged with optional `[tier: …]` annotations to override tier defaults:

- `[tier: default]` — use default tier (Qwen3 for Actor, GLM-5.1 for Planner). Usually omitted.
- `[tier: heavy]` — use heavy tier (Kimi K2.6 for Actor; Sonnet stays for Planner). Used for complex multi-file refactors, architectural changes, or security-sensitive code.

Format: annotation appears on the same line as the step heading (e.g., `### 5. Refactor X [tier: heavy]`). Brain's PLAN parser confirms the annotation exists before dispatching the heavy-tier subagent; if malformed or missing, the step runs at default tier.

### Alias stability contract

SoHoAI exposes agents as aliases: `claude-code-glm-5.1`, `claude-code-qwen3-coder-next`, `claude-code-kimi-k2.6`, etc. These are **stable across deployments** within the SoHoAI domain (as of 2026-05-11, per handoff §1). If the alias routing changes (e.g., DeepSeek → Claude 3.7), SoHoAI commits to rotating the alias URL, not swapping backends silently. Updates will be documented in the design-history.md amendment chain.

Without this contract, cost + quality tracking would drift silently between deployments.

### Reviewer is now Kimi K2.6

Reviewer switched from Sonnet 4.6 to `claude-code-kimi-k2.6` under the flat-rate SoHoAI model. Rationale:
- **Calibration still possible**: Sonnet 4.6 remains available as the Brain's primary model for interactive sessions. Reviewer's verdict can be cross-checked against any Sonnet-based `/duo` plans the operator runs interactively.
- **Quality under flat-rate**: Kimi K2.6 has proven reliable for code review tasks and operates on a flat-rate subscription basis (marginal cost = $0 per invocation), making the review loop economically viable even with cap-3 iteration.
- **Consistency**: Reviewer stays single-model (no multi-model routing per tier); the actor-heavy tier (also Kimi K2.6) provides operational consistency across the implementation and review stages.
