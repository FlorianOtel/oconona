# Research — subagents-vs-headless-revisited-20260428

**Run identifier:** `subagents-vs-headless-revisited-20260428`
**Branch:** `subagents` (local; branched from `headless-claude` at `af9822d`)
**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Operator request:** *"I want to streamline the design and architecture"*

## Goal

Streamline the opencode-orchestra design and architecture by **abandoning the
headless `claude -p` execution model in favor of canonical OpenCode
subagents**, preserving multi-tier model routing for cost discipline while
removing structural complexity that was introduced in commit `98543c0`
("switch from subagents to headless claude sessions") under a partial
misreading of subagent capabilities.

The architectural target is the **idiomatic hub-and-spoke pattern**: a single
orchestrator (Brain, the operator's main OpenCode session) dispatches to
flat sibling specialists (Planner, Actor, Reviewer), each pinned to its own
cost tier. One level of delegation depth, not nested.

## Approach decided

**Revert to subagent execution model on a new `subagents` branch.**

Concretely:

- **Brain** = the operator's main OpenCode session. Orchestrates the
  pipeline. Runs on Sonnet 4.6 minimum / Opus 4.7 recommended for `/brain`,
  Sonnet 4.6 for `/duo`. The operator chooses the model before invoking
  the slash command; Brain's model is not auto-pinned by the framework.
- **Planner** subagent (Sonnet 4.6, read-only) — produces `PLAN.md`.
- **Actor** subagent (Haiku 4.5, read+write) — implements one or more
  approved steps; reports back with diff and `ready_for_review | blocked |
  partial` status signal.
- **Reviewer** subagent (Sonnet 4.6, read-only) — reviews after Actor;
  pass/fail with minimal-fix list.
- **Phase 0 RESEARCH** absorbed by Brain itself — no separate session, no
  separate process, no `Researcher` subagent. Brain wears the
  critical-stance interrogation posture for Phase 0 via its system prompt
  in `commands/brain.md`.

**Permission flow** (canonical Plan-Then-Execute, no escalation tricks):

1. Operator runs `/brain` from a session in **plan mode** (Shift+Tab).
2. Brain runs Phase 0 RESEARCH inline — interrogation, alternatives, scope
   fencing — using read-only tools (enforced by parent plan mode).
3. Operator approves the research conclusion → Brain delegates to Planner.
4. Planner returns `PLAN.md`; operator reviews and approves.
5. Brain calls `ExitPlanMode` → standard OpenCode "auto-edit / manually
   approve / cancel" prompt fires at the parent.
6. Brain delegates to Actor → Actor's tool calls go through the
   permission posture the operator just chose.
7. Brain delegates to Reviewer → pass/fail.

Subagent `permissionMode` frontmatter is used only to **narrow** (Planner
read-only by frontmatter), never to widen. The bypass-flattens-down caveat
(parent's `--dangerously-skip-permissions` overrides children) is documented
prominently as a known constraint.

**Parallel runs** are supported by per-session subdirectories
(`.opencode/orchestra/sessions/<session-id>/PLAN.md`, `TASKS.json`).
Two `/brain` invocations on the same project from separate OpenCode
sessions no longer collide. Lazy cleanup via `find -mtime +30` at `/brain`
start; retention window configurable in `config/config.yaml`.

**`/duo`** re-skins to subagent dispatch: Planner subagent + Actor subagent,
no Reviewer, same plan-mode → ExitPlanMode flow.

**`/brain`** re-skins to inline Phase 0 + Planner → Actor → Reviewer dispatch.

## Rejected alternatives

- **Status quo (headless `claude -p`).** Kludgy, non-idiomatic, plausibly
  *more* expensive than subagents because every invocation cold-starts a new
  process and defeats parent-prompt-cache warm reads (PDF: 90% of subagent
  token cost is cache reads at ~$0.50/MTok on Opus). Requires ~700 lines of
  bespoke registry / tmux / launcher / format-stream plumbing.
- **Agent Teams.** Verified via `code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams`:
  also 1-level deep (lead + flat teammates), still token-expensive (~15× per
  PDF), adds cross-teammate messaging we explicitly don't need, currently
  experimental with documented cleanup issues. Doesn't solve any problem
  subagents don't already solve.
- **Keep multi-tier delegation depth via headless.** False premise. Headless
  never gave us nested delegation; every `claude -p` was already a flat
  sibling spawned by Brain. We paid the complexity tax for capabilities we
  were not, in fact, getting.
- **Keep `agents/researcher.md` as opt-in subagent.** Five of the six
  original rationales for separating Researcher from Brain are disavowed by
  current decisions (different model, clean context, concurrency, cross-day
  resumability, token-cost-stays-out-of-main); the sixth (critical-stance
  posture) is just system-prompt text and moves into `commands/brain.md`.
  Keeping `researcher.md` would leave a 159-line file that nothing invokes.
- **Enable `memory:` field in v1.** Marginal cost benefit at best (CLAUDE.md
  already auto-injects project conventions into subagents); negative
  simplicity impact (new artifact category, stale-memory failure mode,
  cross-project pollution risk for `memory: user`); two mechanisms for the
  same job (PLAN.md/TASKS.json artifacts already do cross-invocation
  handoff). Defer to v2 with documented trigger condition.
- **Maintain `/orchestra-mode` preset command.** The operator did not
  remember the command exists. That alone is sufficient evidence it is not
  earning its slot. Delete.
- **Maintain `/brain-resume`, `/brain-abandon`, `/brain-status`.** All three
  exist solely to navigate the multi-run registry, which is itself being
  deleted. With inline + synchronous `/brain`, "resume" is "stay in the
  session and keep talking" and "abandon" is "type something else." Delete.

## Scope

### In scope

**Architectural changes:**

- Rewrite `commands/brain.md` to absorb Phase 0 RESEARCH inline and
  dispatch Planner → Actor → Reviewer as canonical subagents (Task tool
  invocations).
- Rewrite `commands/duo.md` to dispatch Planner + Actor as canonical
  subagents.
- Update `agents/planner.md`, `agents/actor.md`, `agents/reviewer.md`
  frontmatter and bodies as needed to match canonical subagent invocation
  semantics. Existing `model:` fields are kept (Planner: Sonnet 4.6;
  Actor: Haiku 4.5; Reviewer: Sonnet 4.6).
- Switch artifact paths from flat `.opencode/orchestra/PLAN.md` to per-session
  `.opencode/orchestra/sessions/<session-id>/PLAN.md` (and `TASKS.json`,
  `RESEARCH.md`).
- Add lazy housekeeping: `find -mtime +30` cleanup at `/brain` start; new
  config knob `housekeeping.session_retention_days: 30` in
  `config/config.yaml`.
- Document the bypass-flattens-down caveat prominently in `docs/design.md`
  and in `commands/brain.md` prerequisites.
- Rewrite relevant sections of `docs/design.md` to reflect the new
  architecture; preserve §13 (or equivalent) as a record of why the
  headless detour was attempted and abandoned.
- Document the deferred `memory:` feature with a concrete trigger condition.

**Deletions:**

- `agents/researcher.md`
- `commands/orchestra-mode.md`
- `commands/brain-resume.md`
- `commands/brain-abandon.md`
- `commands/brain-status.md`
- `scripts/start-research.sh`
- `scripts/runs-registry.sh`
- `scripts/run-tier.sh`
- `scripts/format-stream.sh`
- Headless-specific dispatch logic in `scripts/orchestra-hook.sh`
  (PreToolUse may survive if it serves purposes orthogonal to headless;
  SubagentStop and PreCompact handlers wrapping headless workflow go).
- Live-feed / multi-window status-line plumbing tied to headless runs
  (specific files identified in PLAN).
- `.vscode/tasks.json` entries that invoke the headless launcher.

### Out of scope (hard fence)

- Adding any new agent beyond Planner / Actor / Reviewer (e.g., a future
  `Explorer` for parallel codebase investigation per PDF's domain-routing
  pattern). Brain's own Read/Grep/Glob is treated as sufficient for v1.
- Enabling the `memory:` frontmatter field on any subagent.
- Any change to the `./deploy.sh` / `./collect.sh` cycle or the `~/.config/opencode/`
  deploy target. Deploy mechanism stays as-is.
- Cross-project or cross-machine state synchronization. Project-local is
  sufficient.
- A `/brain --mode auto` overnight unattended run with test gate and branch
  isolation. Defer indefinitely.
- Replacing or rearchitecting CLAUDE.md / project-config conventions.
- Merging the new `subagents` branch into `main`. That is a separate
  operator decision after this work lands.
- Cleaning up stale remote branches (`origin/headless-caude` typo branch,
  `origin/headless-claude`, `origin/sub-agents`). Defer.

## Constraints / risks

1. **Bypass-flattens-down caveat.** If the operator launches the parent
   session with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, all subagent
   `permissionMode` frontmatter is silently overridden. Must be documented
   prominently. Mitigation: `commands/brain.md` prerequisites instruct
   operator to launch from a non-bypass session.
2. **CLAUDE.md inheritance into subagents.** Assumed yes (canonical Claude
   Code behavior), but not empirically verified for the OpenCode version
   we are running. **PLAN must include a sanity check** before we rely on
   it. If the assumption fails, agent `.md` bodies need explicit
   re-injection of project conventions.
3. **Cache warmth assumption.** The PDF's claim that ~90% of subagent token
   cost is cache reads holds for *long warm sessions*. Short-lived sessions
   pay closer to the nominal 4–7× multiplier. Real cost behavior on the
   actual opencode-orchestra workload requires post-deployment measurement.
4. **Loss of live visibility into substream work.** Subagents are
   opaque-by-design; the parent transcript shows tool-use events as
   collapsed nodes but not real-time model output. Operator has
   disavowed this as an anti-goal; if the need returns, the only path back
   is the headless approach we are deleting.
5. **Loss of cross-day resumability.** `/brain-resume` is being deleted.
   If a `/brain` run is interrupted mid-flight, the operator stays in the
   same session to continue or re-runs from scratch. No registry to consult.
6. **Per-session subdir + cleanup race.** A `find -mtime +30` cleanup running
   at `/brain` start could in principle delete a subdir whose owning session
   is still active (if a session has been idle for 30 days and is then
   resumed). Mitigation options: (a) accept the constraint and document it;
   (b) skip cleanup if any subdir has been touched in the current calendar
   day. Resolved in PLAN; current preference is (a).
7. **Existing `origin/sub-agents` remote branch.** Pre-headless snapshot
   from `84842ec`, hyphenated name. Untouched by this work. Will need
   operator decision after the new architecture lands about
   merge/delete/rename.

## Open questions

Resolved during PLAN (mechanical):

- Empirical verification that CLAUDE.md auto-injects into subagent system
  prompts in our OpenCode version.
- Whether `permissionMode` frontmatter on Actor/Planner/Reviewer is needed
  given that the parent always sets the effective gate (recommended: omit
  the field, rely on parent state).
- Specific list of headless-related lines in `scripts/orchestra-hook.sh`
  to remove vs. preserve.
- Specific status-line files / blocks tied to headless live-feed UX.
- Migration path for any in-flight `.opencode/orchestra/runs/<id>/` artifacts
  on operator machines (probably: delete on first deploy of new code).

Deferred to v2:

- `Explorer` subagent for parallel codebase investigation.
- `memory:` field opt-in, with a refined trigger condition once telemetry
  exists.
- A test-gate / overnight `/brain --mode auto` workflow.
- Cleanup of stale remote branches.

Operator-only:

- Whether the new `subagents` branch eventually merges to `main` or replaces
  `main`.
- Disposition of `origin/sub-agents` and `origin/headless-claude` after
  merge.
